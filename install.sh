# SteamOS needs a different route entirely, for three reasons that each broke
# an earlier version of this script:
#   * pacman is there but must not be used: python-hidapi conflicts with
#     python-hid, which jupiter-hw-support (the Deck's own hardware support)
#     depends on, and the read-only rootfs reverts on update anyway (#13).
#   * there is no `pip` command (#19).
#   * there is no compiler or headers, so hidapi can't be built from source.
# So on SteamOS the app runs from a private virtual environment in ~/.local
# (survives updates, touches no system package). It bootstraps its own pip from
# Python's bundled ensurepip, installs only PySide6 into it, and sees the
# system's python-hid through --system-site-packages; hidcompat.py adapts that
# library, so no hidapi build is needed at all.

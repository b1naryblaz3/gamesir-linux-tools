"""One interface over the two Python HID libraries that both install as `hid`.

Deadband is written against **cython-hidapi** (PyPI `hidapi`, Arch
`python-hidapi`): ``hid.device()`` + ``open_path()``, ``read()`` returning a list
of ints, ``set_nonblocking()``.

**pyhidapi** (PyPI `hid`, Arch `python-hid`) is a different, ctypes-based library
with a different API -- ``hid.Device(path=...)``, ``read()`` returning bytes, a
``nonblocking`` property, ``HIDException`` -- and it ALSO installs as ``import
hid``. The two conflict at the package level, and SteamOS ships pyhidapi because
``jupiter-hw-support`` (the Steam Deck's own hardware support) depends on it. So
on a Steam Deck the cython one cannot be installed without removing the Deck's
hardware support, and building it from source needs a compiler and headers that
SteamOS doesn't have (issues #13, #19).

Rather than fight that, the app imports this module instead of ``hid``. When
cython-hidapi is installed it is passed straight through, untouched. When only
pyhidapi is, a thin adapter gives it the cython-hidapi shape. pyhidapi loads the
system ``libhidapi-hidraw`` first, so it gets the hidraw backend the app needs.
